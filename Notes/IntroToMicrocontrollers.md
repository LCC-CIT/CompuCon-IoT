<h1>Building Electronic Projects with Raspberry Pi Pico Microcontrollers</h1>



## Microcontrollers

### What are they?

A *microcontroller* is a small, low-power computer. Unlike full-scale computers, microcontrollers are designed to control specific devices or processes, often running a single dedicated program repeatedly.

#### What they do

Microcontrollers read inputs from sensors or buttons, process that information, and send outputs to control devices like motors, lights, displays, or communication modules. They are the “brains” inside many everyday devices — from microwaves to car engines.

#### Different from a single board computer like a Raspberry Pi 

A *microcontroller*, such as a Raspberry Pi Pico, is specialized for running a single task efficiently, usually without an operating system. It uses less power, has limited memory, and often works in real-time.

A *single board computer* (SBC), such as a Raspberry Pi, is a full computer — capable of running an operating system, handling multiple programs at once, and supporting high-level applications like web browsers.

### What they are used for

Microcontrollers power countless embedded systems, including:

- **Consumer electronics** – remote controls, washing machines, thermostats
- **Automotive systems** – engine control units, airbag sensors, anti-lock brakes
- **Industrial machines** – robotics controllers, automation systems
- **Wearable devices** – fitness trackers, smart watches
- **Home automation** – smart lighting, HVAC controls, security systems

## **Internet of Things**

The *Internet of Things (IoT)* refers to a network of physical devices that connect to the internet to collect, exchange, and act on data. These devices often use microcontrollers as their processing units.

The Raspberry Pi Pico boards that we are using in this class have chips that provide Blue Tooth and WiFi connectivity so that they can be connected to other devices or netwrks and to the Internet.
