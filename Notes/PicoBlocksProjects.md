## Pico Blocks IDE
[Pico Bricks IDE](https://ide.picobricks.com/verticalblocks.html)

This can be used for either drag-and-drop visual programming or Python text based programming. It can run programs on a Pico board or a simulator.

- A **Chrome browser is required** to use this IDE.
- It takes about one minute for  the IDE web page to load.

## Pico Bricks Ebooks

[Project Book](../Books/project_book_v2_compressed.pdf)&mdash;This book gives instructions for programming projects using the PicoBlocks MicroBricks IDE, Thonny Python IDE and Arduino IDE with the C programming language.

[IDE Book](../Books/WEB-PicoBricks-IDE-ebook-v2_1_compressed.pdf)&mdash;This book only shows how to program the projects using MicroBricks but gives those instructions in more detail than the other book.

Both books have the same projects. Projects 1 through 11, 13 and 15 can be done with just the Pico Blocks Base kit. Projects 12, 14 and 16 through 25 require components that are not included in the base kit.

## Projects

These are the projects described in the books listed above. The links take you to the code in the IDE docs pages.

1. [Blink](https://ide.picobricks.com/examplesblockly/ExamplesPages/examplesblink.html)&mdash;Make an LED blink on and off
2. [Action - Reaction](https://ide.picobricks.com/examplesblockly/ExamplesPages/examplesaction-reaction.html)&mdash;Turn on an LED when a button is pressed
   Uses an If, Else block with a true/false condition
3. [Autonomous Lighting](https://ide.picobricks.com/examplesblockly/ExamplesPages/examplesautonomous.html)&mdash;Use the LDR light sensor to turn on the RGB  LED. Uses:
   - Serial Print block to monitor a value
   - If, Else block with a number condition
4. [Thermometer](https://ide.picobricks.com/examplesblockly/ExamplesPages/examplesthermometer.html)&mdash;Measure the temperature using the temperature sensor (in the temperature and humidity brick) and show it on the OLED display.
5. [Graphic Monitor](https://ide.picobricks.com/examplesblockly/ExamplesPages/examplesgraphicmonitor.html) &mdash;Use the potentiometer to change the brightness of the RGB LED. Uses:
   - Variables
   - Math operation block
6. [Dominate the Rhythm](https://ide.picobricks.com/examplesblockly/ExamplesPages/examplesdominate.html)&mdash;Play a tune on the  buzzer. Start playing when the button is pressed, control the playing speed with the potentiometer. Show the speed on the display. Uses these kinds of blocks:
   - Variables
   - Math operation
   - Function
   - If, Else with number condition
7. [Show Your Reaction](https://ide.picobricks.com/examplesblockly/ExamplesPages/examplesshowyourreaction.html)&mdash;Turn on the LED after a random delay, then measure the time it takes a player to press the button. Instructions and score are shown on the cisplay. Uses these types of blocks:
   - variables 
   - while with a true/false condition
   - while with a numeric condition
   - functions
   - random number generator
8. [My Timer](https://ide.picobricks.com/examplesblockly/ExamplesPages/examplesmytimer.html)&mdash;Use the potentiometer to set a time in hours, minutes and seconds (press the button after entering each one). Press the button to start the timer. The screen will show the countdown. The buzzer will sound and the RGB LED will light when the time has elapsed. Uses these kinds of blocks:
   - Variables
   - If, else if, else with numeric condition
   - Functions
   - While loop with true/false condition
   - While loop with and condition
   - Math round operation
9. [Alarm Clock](https://ide.picobricks.com/examplesblockly/ExamplesPages/examplesalarmclock.html)&mdash;When the LDR (light sensor) detects light, it shows a "good morning" message on the display, when the button is pressed, it shows "have a nice day"
10. [Know Your Color](https://ide.picobricks.com/examplesblockly/ExamplesPages/examplesknowyourcolor.html)&mdash;
11. Magic Lamp 
12. Smart Cooler 
13. Buzz Wire Game 
14. Dinosaur Game 
15. Night and Day 
16. Voice Controlled Robot Car
    - Uses the wireless (IR) control keypad
17. Two Axis Robot Arm 
18. Smart House 
    - Requires:
    -  HC-SR501 PIR (infrared) motion sensor
    - MQ-2 toxic gas sensor
19. Piggy Bank 
20. NFC Smart Door 

21. Automatic Trash Bin 

22. Digital Ruler 

23. Air Piano 

24. Maze Solver Robot 

25. Smart Greenhouse
