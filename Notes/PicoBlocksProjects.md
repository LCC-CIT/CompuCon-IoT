# PicoBlocks Projects



## Pico Blocks IDE
[Pico Bricks IDE](https://ide.picobricks.com/verticalblocks.html)

This can be used for either drag-and-drop visual programming or Python text based programming. It can run programs on a Pico board or a simulator.

- A **Chrome browser is required** to use this IDE.
- It takes about one minute for  the IDE web page to load.

### Pico Bricks Ebooks

[Project Book](../Books/project_book_v2_compressed.pdf)&mdash;This book gives instructions for programming projects using the PicoBlocks MicroBricks IDE, Thonny Python IDE and Arduino IDE with the C programming language.

[IDE Book](../Books/WEB-PicoBricks-IDE-ebook-v2_1_compressed.pdf)&mdash;This book only shows how to program the projects using MicroBricks but gives those instructions in more detail than the other book.

Both books have the same projects. Projects 1 through 11, 13 and 15 can be done with just the Pico Blocks Base kit. Projects 12, 14 and 16 through 25 require components that are not included in the base kit.
