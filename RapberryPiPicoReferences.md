## Where to Buy Raspberry Pi Pico Hardware

[PiShop](https://www.pishop.us/)&mdash;An official Raspberry Pi store. Their prices are good but you need to pay shipping which can add a lot to the cost of small orders.

[AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/)&mdash;This company is in China so items take a couple weeks to come by mail, but the prices are very low (RP Pico for less than $3.00) and you can get free shipping if you buy $10 or more of qualifying items.

[PicoBricks](https://picobricks.com/collections/raspberry-pi-robotics-kits)&mdash;Educational development boards, project kits and accessories.

### Micro Python

[Thonny](https://thonny.org)
MicroPython IDE

[MicroPython](https://micropython.org)
Official website

 [Get Started with MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico - 2nd Edition](https://store.rpipress.cc/products/get-started-with-micropython-on-raspberry-pi-pico-2nd-edition)
Available for purchase as a print or Kindle book.

## Pico Bricks

[PicoBricks web site](https://picobricks.com/)&mdash;Official web site

[PicoBricks IDEs](https://picobricks.com/pages/ide)
Web page based Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
A **Chrome browser is required** to use these IDEs. 
It takes about one minute for each of the IDE web pages to load.

- [PicoBlocks Jr. IDE](https://ide.picobricks.com/horizontal-blocks/horizontalblocks.html)&mdash;Simplified drag-and-drop visual programming.
- [PicoBlocks IDE](https://ide.picobricks.com/verticalblocks.html)&mdash;Drag-and-drop visual programming or Python text based programming. Can be run programs on a RP Pico board or a simulator.

### Pico Bricks Ebooks and Docs

[Quick Start](https://picobricks.com/pages/picobricks-quick-starter)&mdash;The same book that is included in the PickBricks kit.

[How to Use PicoBricks](https://picobricks.com/pages/how-to-use-picobricks)&mdash;Provides information on using each of the modules on the PicoBricks development board.

[Project Book](https://picobricks.com/pages/picobricks-project-book-v2)&mdash;This book gives instructions for programming projects using the PicoBlocks MicroBricks drag-and-drop IDE, the Thonny Python IDE and the Arduino IDE with the C programming language.

[IDE Book](https://picobricks.com/pages/picobricks-ide-e-book-v2)&mdash;This book only shows how to program the projects using MicroBricks but gives those instructions in more detail than the other book.

Both books have the same projects. Projects 1 through 11 and 15 can be done with just the Pico Blocks Base kit. Projects 12&ndash;14 and 16&ndash;25 require components that are not included in the base kit.

[Wiki](https://docs.picobricks.com/en/latest/)&mdash;Provides much of the same documentation as found elsewhere but with better organization and some additional details.
